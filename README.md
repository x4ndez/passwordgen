## Introduction

This is the Week 3 challenge of the edX/Monash Bootcamp.  The application is a password generator.  You choose alphanumeric, funky (includes special characters) or word-by-word criteria options, and a password length between 8-128 for alphanumeric and funky or 2-20 for word-by-word.

## Developer Comments

In this challenge, I learned more about array and string handling.  I would like to know if there is more efficient ways to write my code, and I'll be querying it in next class.  Next time I think the first thing I'll do is read the acceptance criteria because afterwards I read that I was meant to separate the password criteria by Uppercase, Lowercase and Numeric, which I would have needed to use checkboxes instead of radio buttons; initially I thought there was more flexibility, based on what was told in class, but after I did the challenge I read the acceptance criteria.  The acceptance criteria also states to use prompts but I believe in class, it was stated that there was extra points for not using prompts; hence why I made a form.
